# KasetFairVerse Project - Database/BackEnd/API

ExpressJS is just a name, but this project doesn't strictly follow the framework format. This might cause confusion for those who are new to the project, including the developers working on it.

The project doesn't include a config file on GitHub (I use config instead of .env). However, there is a config-example file that demonstrates the structure. If you need the actual config file, I will provide it to you via Discord (if I haven't forgotten).
